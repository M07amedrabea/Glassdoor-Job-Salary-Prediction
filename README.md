# Job Salary Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes job salary data and builds machine learning models to predict salaries based on job listings. The dataset used is `glassdoor_jobs.csv`.

## Features

- Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - AdaBoost Regressor
- Model evaluation using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared score

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   https://github.com/M07amedrabea/Glassdoor-Job-Salary-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure `glassdoor_jobs.csv` is in the project directory.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook code.ipynb
```

## Results

The project evaluates different models and compares their performance. The best model can be selected based on the evaluation metrics.
